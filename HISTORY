0.0.1 - 0.1.0 
* Initial drop and bug fixes. Not that interesting...

0.1.1
* Updated mongo store strategy
  * Tossed out mongo mapper. Trying to stay closer to the metal
  * Shortened col names for saving space. Unfortunately lame but necessary
  * Moved user info into separate collection.
  
0.2.0
* YAML options - You can now load the rack component from a yaml file. This is
  very handy in framework where Rackamole options varies depending on the environment.
  Please refer to spec/test_configs/rackamole_test.yml for an example
  
0.2.2
* NOTICE: Wrong docs and wrong configuration for mongo store initialization
  * Corrected docs and validation for mongo store init - changed :database to :db_name
  
0.2.3
* Bug fixes
  * Fixed issue where session or param key falls under the format a.b.c which causes 
    validation problems in mongoDB. Thanks Rafael!
    
0.2.4
* Breaking off action_mailer dependencies. Now leveraging Pony for sending out email alerts.

0.2.5
* Added support for excluding certain params from request or session.
  See the params_excludes and session_excludes options.
  
0.2.6
* Added logging for response information such as status, headers and body. Body is excluded by default
* Added options for excluding certain mole information for being logged see mole_excludes option.
* Eliminated unwise defaults. From now, the option :app_name must be specified when initializing.
  The option :db_name must also be present if the mongo store is used.
  Keep in mind for rackamole to work with wackamole your db name must follow: mole_{app_name}_{environment}_mdb.
  
0.2.7
* Bug fixes and cleanup
* Added user_agent parsing. now extracting os/platform/version as well as browser type and version.
