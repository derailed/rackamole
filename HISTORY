0.0.1 - 0.1.0 
* Initial drop and bug fixes. Not that interesting...

0.1.1
* Updated mongo store strategy
  * Tossed out mongo mapper. Trying to stay closer to the metal
  * Shortened col names for saving space. Unfortunately lame but necessary
  * Moved user info into separate collection.
  
0.2.0
* YAML options - You can now load the rack component from a yaml file. This is
  very handy in framework where Rackamole options varies depending on the environment.
  Please refer to spec/test_configs/rackamole_test.yml for an example
